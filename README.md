####### Primer Designing Tool
This is my **final project** for the course *Bioinformatics Software Development*.
Our teacher gave us permission to use **ChatGPT or other coding assistance**, but the important condition is to **understand the tool and its logic** because viva will test our concepts. I developed this tool after **long nights of work and solving technical issues**, based on my own idea of a **simple and colorful GUI for primer designing**.

## ‚ú® Features

* GUI-based (Tkinter with vibrant & contrasting colors).
* Accepts **DNA sequence input**.
* Calculates:

  * **Primer length**
  * **GC Content (%)**
  * **Melting Temperature (Tm)**
* Generates **forward & reverse primers** automatically.
* Easy-to-use interface with all outputs visible on screen.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
pip install biopython
```

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

```bash
python Primer_Designing_Tool.py
```

1. Enter your DNA sequence in the input box.
2. Click **Design Primers**.
3. View results: primers, GC content, Tm, and length.


## üé® GUI

* Vibrant button colors for better contrast.
* Well-spaced layout so all results fit neatly on one page.
* Beginner-friendly design.


## üìå Note
I fully understand the tool‚Äôs functionality and logic, so I can confidently explain it during viva.
